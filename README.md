　　物有心，只是未遇不平而默然，韩退之言：物得不平则鸣。如此看来，凡物皆可作声。春谷山庄里处处有声，风吹竹声，淅沥如虫语，风入松声，如海涛呼啸，长而如龙凤之鸣。有虫吟，如蝉之嘒嘒，螽斯之织织，蚁行于草茎，螬蛴之于遁土。有鸟鸣，鸟鸣啾啾，时起时止，如私语。有泉流淙淙，如柔指连拂琴弦……如此皆为音调，凑而成乐。孔子问乐于长弘，
	20、今天的清风洋溢着喜悦与欢乐，今天的空气弥漫着幸福与甜蜜，请伸出你们的双手，接住我对你们的祝福，愿你们白首偕老，新婚大喜。

Grew up since childhood in the countryside, it is really a blessing in my life.
And let me recall after so many years, still thankful, inexplicable excitement!
Punch in a bunch of money rain, pop-up countless transparent note, let me first taste the taste of what is exciting!
Obedient I at ordinary times, the ear has not hear adults Shouting, bare feet into the rain, curious. Excited, trample ah. Step.
Wet permeability, but those who constantly pop-up note, but always can't finish the step on!
They, the tease me like a bright teal.
I have grown up, work for several years, appearance is no longer that keep a line head bang, eyes have no that kind of pure shiny things, all with just a one of the world.
Teacher is old, older than before, riding on the back of the car has summoned the seasoned with a large package, unchanged or he that a head of white hair, and that the smoke of the clip in his hand.
